//You should make your project readeble for another people. To increse readeble you should split your code into parts and part them to different files.
//We have a App.js. From this file React starts rendering. If we add all of our code into this file, we can easely get confused. 
//We should create a new file, name it "content_name"(Best practice) and transer our code there.

const Component = () => {/* In these brackets we can put HTML sytax. But first we have to add a "return"*/
  return( /* We may not whrite a round brackets if we create a <div> at the first string. I like parentheses, so i'll write them. */
    <div> Your Layout  /* You can't add a layout outside the first <div>. Also you can't use more than one <div>. This important and nessassarly to remember. */
    </div>
